    <h1>What is Benefit?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Benefit is the proof that chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo works. It appears in two forms—conspicuous benefit that you can see immediately, and inconspicuous benefit that quietly transforms the direction of your life.</p>
    <p>Nichiren Daishonin emphasized that true benefit is not a reward from outside. It is the natural function of the Mystic Law operating within our lives. When we chant with faith and take courageous action, benefit emerges in ways that deepen happiness for ourselves and others.</p>

    <h2>Conspicuous benefit: visible victories</h2>
    <p>Conspicuous benefit refers to the quick, unmistakable results that follow determined prayer and action.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Receiving a job offer after chanting with a vow to contribute more at work.</li>
      <li>Experiencing a breakthrough in health or finances after consistent daimoku and guidance.</li>
      <li>Resolving a difficult relationship through a heartfelt apology inspired by practice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These victories fuel our conviction. They show that the Law responds to sincere faith. Yet Nichiren also cautioned that benefit is not limited to immediate results.</p>

    <h2>Inconspicuous benefit: deep transformation</h2>
    <p>Inconspicuous benefit accumulates over time. It is the growing fortitude, wisdom, and compassion that appear as we chant every day.</p>
    <div class="notice">
      <p>Inconspicuous benefit may look like newfound patience, stronger determination to fulfill responsibilities, or the courage to help others overcome suffering. It is the invisible current that steadily steers life toward happiness.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Because this transformation is internal, we sometimes notice it only when we compare our present self with who we were months or years ago. Friends may comment that we seem calmer or more confident. Challenges that once felt crushing become opportunities to create value.</p>

    <h2>Faith, practice, and study create lasting benefit</h2>
    <p>Benefit unfolds when the three essentials of Nichiren Shoshu work together.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faith:</strong> Trust the Gohonzon and make bold determinations that align with the happiness of self and others.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Chant daily, perform Gongyo, attend temple activities, and share Buddhism—this is how we polish life.</li>
      <li><strong>Study:</strong> Reading the Gosho and hearing guidance from the priest clarifies how to apply Buddhist principles to daily situations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whenever we face resistance, we increase prayer instead of retreating. Obstacles become the raw material for even greater benefit.</p>

    <h2>Share victories to encourage others</h2>
    <p>Benefit is meant to be shared. When you talk about the changes you have experienced—large or small—you inspire others to try chanting. Nichiren called this spirit <em>shakubuku</em>, refuting suffering by helping others embrace the Mystic Law.</p>
    <p>Write your victories in a journal, share them during meetings, and encourage newcomers who are just beginning to chant. Your story may be the exact encouragement someone needs to continue practicing.</p>
