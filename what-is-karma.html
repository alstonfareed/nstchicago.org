    <h1>What is Karma?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Karma is action—thoughts, words, and deeds—that shapes future experiences. In Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, karma is never fixed; chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and taking compassionate action transform even the deepest causes.</p>
    <p>Nichiren Daishonin described karma as seeds that inevitably blossom. When the causes we plant are rooted in the Mystic Law, those seeds produce wisdom, benefit, and joy. Even when past karma manifests as hardship, it can become the raw material for enlightenment.</p>

    <h2>Cause and effect through the lens of True Buddhism</h2>
    <p>Karma operates according to the principle of cause and effect. Every action leaves an imprint on our lives and our environment. Nichiren clarified three important points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Karma is cumulative.</strong> Causes from this life and countless past exist simultaneously within our lives.</li>
      <li><strong>Karma is shared.</strong> Families, workplaces, and communities experience effects together, which is why transforming our own life uplifts others.</li>
      <li><strong>Karma is changeable.</strong> Chanting to the Gohonzon activates Buddhahood, enabling us to rewrite negative tendencies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rather than feeling bound by destiny, we use karma as motivation to create better causes each day.</p>

    <h2>Transforming karma through practice</h2>
    <p>Nichiren taught that the fastest way to change karma is to embrace the Three Treasures: the Buddha (Nichiren Daishonin), the Law (Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo), and the Priesthood that protects the Law. When we chant before the Gohonzon, the powers of the Buddha and the Law well forth, purifying negative causes.</p>
    <blockquote>“Even a small drop of poison becomes harmless when mixed with a great river.” —Nichiren Daishonin, <em>The Daimoku of the Lotus Sutra</em></blockquote>
    <p>Through daimoku we fuse our lives with the Mystic Law. Obstacles that seemed immovable become opportunities to prove the strength of faith. Karma that once produced suffering becomes fuel for courage and compassion.</p>

    <h2>Steps to reshape karma</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Chant earnestly each day.</strong> Consistent daimoku is the engine that changes the direction of life.</li>
      <li><strong>Do Gongyo with gratitude.</strong> Reciting the Lotus Sutra passages reminds us that Buddhahood is our true identity.</li>
      <li><strong>Seek guidance.</strong> The chief priest and senior members help us interpret hardships through the Gosho.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice for others.</strong> Encouraging someone else to chant creates immeasurable positive causes and lightens our own burdens.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="notice">
      <p>When we encounter difficulties after beginning practice, it often means negative karma is surfacing so it can be eradicated. Redouble your chanting and stay close to the temple—victory is imminent.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>From suffering to mission</h2>
    <p>Many members at Myogyoji have experienced dramatic shifts: illnesses improving, relationships healing, financial struggles stabilizing. More importantly, they discover a mission—to use their experiences to encourage others. This is karma transformed into Buddhahood.</p>
    <p>By embracing <em>itai doshin</em> (“many in body, one in mind”), we support one another in changing karma. Collective prayer and unity accelerate benefit for everyone connected to the temple.</p>
