            </header>
            <p class="faq-summary">Buddhism teaches that every being possesses an enlightened nature, and that the rhythm governing the universe‚ÄîMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äîcan be experienced in daily life. Nichiren Shoshu clarifies that this universal Law is not an abstract philosophy; it is activated when we chant and align our actions with compassionate wisdom. By practicing, studying, and sharing Buddhism with others, we polish our lives like mirrors so that courage, wisdom, and benefit naturally emerge.</p>
            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>Nichiren Daishonin taught that the purpose of Buddhism is to enable people ‚Äúto enjoy happiness in the present world.‚Äù The Law is accessible to anyone, regardless of background or past causes. When we chant Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo before the Gohonzon, we activate the same enlightened life-condition embodied by the Buddha. Over time, we feel an unshakeable life state and see visible improvements in relationships, work, health, and community.</p>
              <p>Three essentials guide our growth: faith (confidence in the Law), practice (chanting and Gongyo), and study (learning the teachings). Each supports the others. Sharing Buddhism with friends or family expands our own life force and advances kosen-rufu‚Äîthe widespread propagation of true Buddhism.</p>

            <p class="faq-summary">Shakyamuni lived in India about 3,000 years ago. He awakened to the truth that life is governed by cause and effect and shared methods to overcome suffering. His highest teaching, the Lotus Sutra, predicts the appearance of the True Buddha who would reveal the Law for the Latter Day of the Law.</p>
            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>Shakyamuni‚Äôs example shows how to seek the Law and dedicate our lives to relieving others‚Äô suffering. Yet, he also stated that his teachings would gradually lose efficacy after 2,000 years. He therefore urged people to follow the successor who would reveal the ultimate Law‚Äîfulfilling the prophecy that Nichiren Daishonin later proved.</p>

            <p class="faq-summary">The Lotus Sutra is Shakyamuni‚Äôs highest teaching. It proclaims that all people can reveal Buddhahood and predicts the appearance of the True Buddha who will establish the practice for the Latter Day of the Law.</p>
            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>Across 28 chapters, the Lotus Sutra reveals that the Buddha‚Äôs life span is eternal and that his enlightenment serves to awaken others. It describes the Ceremony in the Air‚Äîa grand gathering where countless Buddhas entrust disciples to spread the Mystic Law.</p>
              <p>Nichiren Daishonin identified the essence of the sutra as Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and inscribed the Gohonzon so we can directly access that ceremony each time we chant. Every Gongyo recitation includes excerpts from Chapters Two and Sixteen, keeping us in rhythm with the sutra.</p>

            </header>
            <p class="faq-summary">Nichiren Daishonin (1222‚Äì1282) is the founder of Nichiren Shoshu. Living in 13th-century Japan, he studied every Buddhist teaching available, then declared that chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äîderived from the Lotus Sutra‚Äîis the sole practice that enables all people to achieve enlightenment in the Latter Day of the Law. He inscribed the Dai-Gohonzon so that future generations could experience the same life state as the Buddha.</p>
            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>Nichiren endured persecution, exile, and assassination attempts because he unflinchingly refuted erroneous teachings and protected the correct Law. His writings, the Gosho, give precise guidance on faith, daily practice, and fostering harmonious communities. He taught disciples to unite with the High Priest of the Head Temple to maintain the pure lineage of the Three Treasures.</p>
              <p>Studying Nichiren‚Äôs life shows how one person‚Äôs vow can transform society. His spirit lives on when we chant with determination, share Buddhism, and support our temple so countless people can awaken to their true potential.</p>

            </header>
            <p class="faq-summary">Karma means ‚Äúaction.‚Äù Every thought, word, and deed leaves an imprint in our lives that manifests as present or future results. Rather than a fatalistic verdict, Nichiren Shoshu teaches karma as a hopeful principle: by chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and taking constructive action, we transform negative causes and create benefit for ourselves, our families, and society.</p>
            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>Nichiren likened karma to seeds that produce flowers or weeds depending on what we plant. When we chant, study, and act based on the Gohonzon, we infuse even past causes with the energy of the Mystic Law. Old sufferings can become fuel for growth, wisdom, and compassion. We prove this through concrete victories‚Äîbetter health, reconciled relationships, steady finances, or newfound purpose.</p>
              <p>Supporting others to chant also changes karma because it is the most compassionate action. As we help each other overcome hardships, we strengthen the itai-doshin spirit of unity in diversity.</p>

            </header>
            <p class="faq-summary">The Ten Worlds describe ten life conditions‚Äîfrom Hell, Hunger, and Anger up to Bodhisattva and Buddhahood‚Äîthat we experience moment to moment. Nichiren Shoshu explains that these states exist within each person. Through chanting, we elevate our basic life tendency so that higher worlds like Learning, Realization, Bodhisattva, and Buddha emerge more often, even in challenging situations.</p>
            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>Recognizing the Ten Worlds helps us respond wisely to our own emotions and to others. Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo instantly taps Buddhahood, which includes all worlds in harmony. As a result, we can transform anger into determination, or anxiety into compassion-driven action.</p>
              <p>Daily practice and temple activities nurture the Bodhisattva world‚Äîcaring for others‚Äîwhile study deepens wisdom. This internal change naturally influences our environment, showing that true revolution starts within.</p>

            <p class="faq-summary">The Gohonzon is the sacred mandala inscribed by Nichiren Daishonin, embodying the enlightened life of the True Buddha.

              <p>The characters on the Gohonzon depict the ceremony where Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and protective forces pledge to safeguard practitioners of Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo. When we chant before the Gohonzon, our lives enter that ceremony, fusing with the wisdom and compassion it represents.</p>
              <p>Receiving the Gohonzon is a profound step rooted in faith, practice, and study. Temple guidance ensures we understand how to care for it respectfully and integrate daily practice into our lives.</p>

            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>During Gongyo we recite the <em>Hoben</em> (Expedient Means) and <em>Juryo</em> (Life Span) chapters in Japanese, then offer five silent prayers expressing gratitude to the Three Treasures and pledging to advance kosen-rufu. The rhythm of Gongyo sharpens our determination and nourishes consistency.</p>
              <p>At Myogyoji, beginners can attend slow Gongyo sessions on Wednesday evenings to learn pronunciation and rhythm. Practicing together creates unity and encouragement.</p>

            <p class="faq-summary">Zen Buddhism emphasizes seated meditation and koan practice, while Nichiren Shoshu centers on chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo to the Gohonzon. Nichiren Shoshu directly taps the Mystic Law revealed in the Lotus Sutra, enabling immediate access to Buddhahood in daily life.</p>
            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>Zen often focuses on personal insight achieved through silent meditation. Nichiren Shoshu emphasizes a vibrant, vocal practice that fuses self and environment, supported by the lineage of the Three Treasures. It provides a clear doctrinal foundation based on the Lotus Sutra and Nichiren‚Äôs writings.</p>
              <p>Both traditions value discipline and compassion, but Nichiren Shoshu uniquely teaches the single practice suited for the Latter Day of the Law.</p>

            <p class="faq-summary">Vocalizing Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo engages our whole being‚Äîmind, body, and environment. Sound carries determination and moves life force; chanting aloud awakens dormant potential and inspires others to join in.</p>
            <div class="faq-more" hidden>
              <p>Nichiren taught that the voice does the Buddha‚Äôs work. Chanting aloud harmonizes our breath, heart, and environment with the Mystic Law. It also enables us to chant together, amplifying benefit through collective prayer.</p>
              <p>Maintain a comfortable, steady rhythm. Over time, your voice becomes powerful and confident, reflecting inner transformation.</p>

            <p class="faq-summary">No prior background is required. Nichiren Shoshu welcomes people of every age, culture, and faith tradition. The practice is designed for the Latter Day of the Law‚Äîan age characterized by diversity and complexity.</p>

              <p>All you need is an open heart and a willingness to try chanting. Temple members can guide you through Gongyo, explain silent prayers, and share study materials. Many start with just five minutes of chanting twice a day and gradually build from there.</p>
              <p>Faith grows through experience. Bring your questions, explore at your own pace, and rely on the temple community for support.</p>
