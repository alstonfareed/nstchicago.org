    <h1>What is Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo is the title of the Mystic Law—the fundamental rhythm that gives rise to every phenomenon in the universe. Chanting it aloud is how we align our lives with that Law and reveal the state of Buddhahood.</p>
    <p>Nichiren Daishonin taught that this phrase contains both the cause and the effect of enlightenment. The moment we chant, we awaken the Buddha nature inherent in all people and activate infinite wisdom, courage, and compassion.</p>

    <h2>The meaning within each character</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nam</strong> means “to dedicate one’s life.” It expresses our vow to rely on the Mystic Law.</li>
      <li><strong>Myoho</strong> translates as “mystic law,” indicating the wondrous interplay of cause and effect.</li>
      <li><strong>Renge</strong> means “lotus flower,” which blooms and seeds simultaneously, symbolizing cause and effect happening together.</li>
      <li><strong>Kyo</strong> means “sutra” or “teaching,” representing the unchanging rhythm that pervades past, present, and future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When we chant the entire phrase, we unite our lives with the eternal law of Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo. It is not a mantra to recite mechanically; it is an expression of determination to transform our lives and help others do the same.</p>

    <h2>Chanting activates Buddhahood</h2>
    <p>Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo contains the enlightened life-condition of the Buddha. Chanting brings that condition to the forefront of our lives, enabling us to respond to any circumstance with wisdom and compassion rather than fear or doubt.</p>
    <blockquote>“Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo is exactly the same as what the Buddha Shakyamuni himself practiced.” —Nichiren Daishonin, <em>Letter to Niike</em></blockquote>
    <p>Because our voice vibrates with the Mystic Law, chanting also purifies our environment. Families, workplaces, and communities naturally benefit when we chant with a vow for everyone’s happiness.</p>

    <h2>How to chant at Myogyoji Temple</h2>
    <p>Chanting is accessible and rhythmic. You can begin with a few minutes morning and evening and extend the time as your determination grows.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Set your intention.</strong> Sit comfortably facing the Gohonzon or a quiet space, and decide what you are praying for.</li>
      <li><strong>Chant aloud with energy.</strong> Maintain a steady beat and clear pronunciation: “Nam-myo-ho-ren-ge-kyo.”</li>
      <li><strong>Follow with Gongyo.</strong> Recite parts of the Lotus Sutra in the traditional Liturgy to harmonize with the priesthood and fellow believers.</li>
      <li><strong>Close with gratitude.</strong> Offer silent prayers that express appreciation and resolve to share Buddhism with others.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="notice">
      <p>Consistency is more important than the amount of time. Chant every day, even briefly. The more you chant, the more responsive and resilient your life becomes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Results you can trust</h2>
    <p>As you chant Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo, you will notice tangible changes: courage to confront challenges, insight to make wise decisions, and compassion that deepens relationships. This is called benefit. Some victories appear quickly; others unfold over months or years as inconspicuous benefit reshapes the direction of your life.</p>
    <p>Chanting also inspires action. It gives you the resolve to take courageous steps—seeking medical care, applying for a new position, reconciling with family, or encouraging a friend to chant alongside you. These actions become causes for even greater benefit.</p>
