    <h1>Difference Between Zen and Nichiren Shoshu</h1>
    <p class="lead">Zen emphasizes meditation and direct insight; Nichiren Shoshu is based on the Lotus Sutra and the practice of chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo to the Gohonzon as the direct path to Buddhahood.</p>

    <h2>Zen teaching versus the Lotus Sutra</h2>
    <p>The Zen sect asserts that enlightenment is not to be found in the pursuit of doctrinal studies, but only through the direct perception of one’s own mind with the practice of meditation. Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism is based on the Lotus Sutra, which is the Buddha’s legitimate teaching. Nichiren Daishonin stated:</p>
    <blockquote>The Zen sect rejects the sutras. It claims that they are in the category of the written word. Instead, it teaches “a separate transmission outside the sutras, independent of scripture or words.” (Gosho, p. 1308)</blockquote>
    <p>Thus, their arguments are based merely upon the words of the teachers of doctrine and not upon the Buddha’s teaching. The Daishonin said:</p>
    <blockquote>When he taught the metaphor of the five flavors, correlating them to the five periods, the Buddha proclaimed that the Lotus Sutra alone was supreme. He stated that of all the sutras he “has preached, now preaches, and will preach,” the Lotus Sutra is unrivaled on the path to attain enlightenment. These are the golden words of the Buddha. (Gosho, p. 1309)</blockquote>
    <p>Therefore, we can attain enlightenment only through the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, but we cannot manifest the Buddha nature by the practice of mere meditation.</p>

    <h2>Core practice in Nichiren Shoshu</h2>
    <p>Nichiren Daishonin identified chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo to the Gohonzon as the single practice suited for the Latter Day of the Law. The Gohonzon embodies the life of the True Buddha. Each time we chant, we participate in the eternal Ceremony in the Air described in the Lotus Sutra and awaken our inherent Buddhahood in daily life.</p>

    <h2>Comparison with other Buddhist traditions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Theravada:</strong> Focuses on monastic discipline and personal liberation through meditation and insight into impermanence. Nichiren Shoshu teaches universal enlightenment through chanting accessible to laypeople.</li>
      <li><strong>Tibetan (Vajrayana):</strong> Employs esoteric rituals, mantras, and initiations. Nichiren Shoshu emphasizes the open, universal Law of Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo without secret doctrines.</li>
      <li><strong>Pure Land:</strong> Encourages chanting the name of Amida Buddha to be reborn in a distant pure land. Nichiren Shoshu reveals that Buddhahood is realized here and now through the Gohonzon.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While many schools offer meaningful practices, Nichiren Shoshu alone preserves the exact method Nichiren Daishonin established for the Latter Day.</p>

    <h2>Differences among Nichiren-based groups</h2>
    <p>Several schools trace their roots to Nichiren, but their doctrines and connections to the Three Treasures differ.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nichiren Shoshu:</strong> Maintains the unbroken lineage from Nichiren to the present High Priest. The High Priest transcribes Gohonzon and bestows them through authorized temples.</li>
      <li><strong>Nichiren Shu and other traditional schools:</strong> Emphasize study and recitation of the Lotus Sutra but do not recognize the exclusive authority of the Dai-Gohonzon or the High Priest’s lineage.</li>
      <li><strong>Soka Gakkai International (SGI):</strong> Originally affiliated with Nichiren Shoshu but separated in 1991. SGI no longer receives guidance or Gohonzon from the Head Temple and has adopted independent doctrines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For believers who wish to follow the teaching exactly as Nichiren taught it, uniting with Nichiren Shoshu and supporting their local temple ensures the full transmission of the Law.</p>
